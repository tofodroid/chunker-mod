# Chunker - Dynamic Chunk Borders

## Overview
Chunker is a small mod that allows for chunks to be "locked" and "unlocked" for player movement. Players are restricted to moving within "unlocked" chunks but the rest of the world works as normal (entities and move through any chunk regardless of status). Mod releases are available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods).

## Downloads
**Official JAR builds of the mod will be posted on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods) and only on CurseForge. If you find a JAR download on any site other than CurseForge it is not an official build and you may be putting your system at risk if you use it.**

## Redistributing
This mod may be included in modpacks. If you choose to redistribute the mod JAR itself outside of the official [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods) page note the conditions of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and understand that from my point of view your build will be considered unofficial as noted in the section above.

## Minecraft Versions
Chunker is a mod that I am developing in my spare time and as such it will only be supporting a limited subset of Minecraft and Forge versions. When a new version is released it may take some time for the mod to be updated. Fabric is not supported and will not be supported by me, but if someone would like to port the mod to Fabric that would be fine! The current versions that this mod officially supports are outlined in the overview above.

## Forking and Contribtuing
Feel free to fork the mod (note the conditions of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)) and/or provide pull requests back to this repository! I do not spend a great deal of time on working on this mod or monitoring the GitHub page so it is possible that pull requests may sit for some time before I see them but I will do my best to review them as soon as possible!
